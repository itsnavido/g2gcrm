# Role-Based Access Control Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a complete role-based access control system with Discord OAuth authentication, admin panel, and user management.

## Owner Configuration
- **Owner Discord ID**: `339703905166426114`
- **Automatic Role Assignment**: Owner role is automatically assigned on first login
- **Automatic Approval**: Owner status is set to 'approved' immediately

## Role Hierarchy
1. **Owner** (Purple badge)
   - Full system access
   - Can promote/demote admins
   - Can approve/ban any user
   - Cannot be banned or demoted

2. **Admin** (Blue badge)
   - Can approve new users
   - Can ban/unban regular users
   - Cannot ban other admins
   - Can view activity logs
   - Access to admin panel

3. **User** (Gray badge)
   - Requires approval after first login
   - Access to dashboard after approval
   - Can be promoted to admin by owner

## User States
- **Pending**: New users awaiting approval
- **Approved**: Users with full access
- **Banned**: Users denied access

## Backend Implementation

### Models Created
1. **User Model** (`backend/models/User.js`)
   - Added `role` field (user/admin/owner)
   - Added `status` field (pending/approved/banned)
   - Added `approved_by`, `approved_at` fields
   - Added `last_activity` field

2. **ActivityLog Model** (`backend/models/ActivityLog.js`)
   - Tracks all admin actions
   - Records: user_id, action, target_user_id, details, timestamp
   - Indexed for efficient querying

### Auth Middleware
- `isAuthenticated`: Checks auth + approval status
- `isAdmin`: Checks for admin or owner role
- `isOwner`: Checks for owner role only

### Admin API Routes
- `GET /api/admin/users` - Get all users (Admin)
- `POST /api/admin/users/:id/approve` - Approve user (Admin)
- `POST /api/admin/users/:id/ban` - Ban user (Admin)
- `POST /api/admin/users/:id/unban` - Unban user (Admin)
- `POST /api/admin/users/:id/promote` - Promote to admin (Owner only)
- `POST /api/admin/users/:id/demote` - Demote from admin (Owner only)
- `GET /api/admin/logs` - Get activity logs (Admin)

### Updated Routes
- `GET /` - Now returns JSON with auth status
- `GET /auth/user` - Includes role and status
- `GET /auth/status` - Includes role and status

## Frontend Implementation

### New Pages
1. **Login Page** (`frontend/src/pages/Login.jsx`)
   - Beautiful gradient design
   - Discord OAuth button
   - Error handling for failed auth

2. **Access Denied Page** (`frontend/src/pages/AccessDenied.jsx`)
   - Shows user info and status
   - Pending approval message
   - Logout button

3. **Admin Panel** (`frontend/src/pages/Admin.jsx`)
   - **Users Tab**: User management table with actions
   - **Activity Logs Tab**: Complete audit trail
   - Role-based action visibility
   - Real-time updates

### Updated Components
1. **App.jsx** - Authentication wrapper
   - Loading state
   - Login redirect for unauthenticated
   - Access denied redirect for pending users
   - Full dashboard for approved users

2. **Sidebar** - User info section
   - User avatar with Discord CDN
   - Username display
   - Role badge with color coding
   - Logout button
   - Admin Panel link (for admins/owner)

3. **API Config** - Enhanced interceptors
   - 401 → redirect to login
   - 403 → redirect to access denied
   - withCredentials for sessions

### New Store
**Auth Store** (`frontend/src/stores/useAuthStore.js`)
- User state management
- `checkAuth()` - Verify authentication
- `logout()` - End session
- Helper methods: `isAuthenticated()`, `isApproved()`, `isAdmin()`, `isOwner()`

## Security Features
- Session-based authentication with MongoDB storage
- CORS configured with credentials
- Role validation on all protected routes
- Owner cannot be banned or demoted
- Admins cannot ban other admins
- Activity logging for accountability

## User Flow

### First-Time Owner Login
1. Clicks "Login with Discord"
2. Redirects to Discord OAuth
3. Returns to app with session
4. Auto-assigned owner role + approved status
5. Full dashboard access immediately

### First-Time Regular User Login
1. Clicks "Login with Discord"
2. Redirects to Discord OAuth
3. Returns to app with session
4. Status set to "pending"
5. Sees "Access Denied - Pending Approval" page
6. Waits for admin approval

### Admin Approval Process
1. Admin logs in to dashboard
2. Navigates to Admin Panel
3. Views Users tab
4. Clicks "Approve" on pending user
5. User can now access dashboard

## Activity Tracking
All admin actions are logged:
- `approve_user` - User approved
- `ban_user` - User banned
- `unban_user` - User unbanned
- `promote_admin` - User promoted to admin
- `demote_admin` - Admin demoted to user

Logs include:
- Timestamp
- Admin who performed action
- Target user
- Action details
